            <p>
                In the world of technology, I've learned to use different tools to make cool
                stuff on the internet.<br> I'm good at HTML, which helps me create the structure
                of websites and make them user-friendly.<br> When it comes to programming, I am acquainted
                languages like C, C++, Java and Python.
            </p>
            <p>
                With C, C++ and Java, I dive into solving problems and designing smart ways for 
                computers to handle information. It's like solving puzzles, and I enjoy 
                figuring out the best ways to make things work smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python is another language I useâ€”it's like the Swiss Army knife of 
                programming. I can do a bunch of things with it, from making tasks easier to
                diving into cool areas like machine learning and data analysis.
                But it's not just about writing lines of code for me. I also love exploring
                the business side of things. Winning a prize in a national business event 
                showed me how I can take my tech skills and use them to create real-world
                solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a nutshell, my skills aren't just about knowing languages; they're about
                having a mindset that loves learning new things, adapting to challenges, 
                and turning ideas into reality. Every project I work on is like crafting
                something special, and my skills are the tools that help me shape the
                future in the exciting world of computer science.

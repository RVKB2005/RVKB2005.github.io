                <p>
                    I'm currently in my first year of college at Sri Sairam Engineering College, studying
                    Computer Science and Business Systems. College is like a big learning adventure, and I'm excited to
                    dive into my chosen field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm learning about all sorts of interesting things related to Programming.
                    It's not just about textbooks, it's about discovering how things work in the
                    real world. I believe that what I'm learning now will be the foundation for
                    cool stuff I'll do in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm always curious and ready to explore new ideas. College is not just
                    about classes, it's a journey where I get to discover, learn, and grow.
                    I'm looking forward to turning my academic knowledge into hands-on 
                    experiences and projects that make a real impact.
